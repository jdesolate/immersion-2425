		<div id= "Information"> Jodia Jace Rajl V. Catada was born on Feburary 18, 2008 in the island of Cebu. He was raised in the island of Bohol after living in Cebu and Ormoc, Leyte. He was born as the first child of his parents and at the age of 9, became an older brother of his new baby sister. He went to Prodigy Discovery School and graduated preschool and elementary in said school. During his time there, he was known to be extremely hyper and loud but also intellectually gifted in another way. Achievements he achieved during his time there were very limited as he was only able to achieve things he was competent enough to achieve. After graduating from P.D.S., he was able to acquire a scholarship in the Central Visayas Campus of the Philippine Science High School. After a few major events after his graduation such as the global pandemic, COVID-19, Jodia spent 2 years of online learning as face-to-face contact was restricted to avoid the spread of said pandemic. After all of this, as well as some minor events in his life, we find ourselves in the present day exploring this website.</div>
